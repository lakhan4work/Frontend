Frontend — Learning Playground & Assignments

A structured, branch-oriented frontend learning repository that walks through HTML & CSS fundamentals, layout systems (Flexbox/Grid), media embedding, and responsive design — with small assignments for each topic.
Cleanly separated branches make this repo ideal for step-by-step learning, demoing concepts, and showing progress on GitHub.

What this repo is for

This repository is a hands-on, incremental frontend learning project. Each branch focuses on a single topic (HTML basics → CSS → Layouts → Responsive design). The repo contains example pages, demo files, and assignment solutions so you — or anyone reading the repo — can:

Learn HTML structure and semantic elements.

Practice block vs inline, positioning, and iframes.

Explore CSS selectors, box model, animations, and transitions.

Build responsive layouts using media queries and Flexbox.

See short assignments that reinforce each topic.

This README explains the structure, what each branch contains, how to run the demos locally, and step-by-step instructions to upload or update this README on GitHub.
